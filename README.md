 🧠 Mental Health LLM - AI-Powered Depression Level Prediction  

This project utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **deep learning** to analyze textual inputs and predict **depression levels**. The system helps assess mental health by classifying text into categories such as **mild, moderate, severe, and minimal depression**.  



🌟 Project Overview  
Mental health is crucial, and early detection of depressive symptoms can lead to timely intervention. This project integrates **BERT-based NLP models** with **LLMs** to analyze user text and provide **mental health insights**.  

🔹 Input: User-provided text describing thoughts or emotions  
🔹 Processing: NLP-based sentiment & depression level analysis  
🔹 Output: Predicted depression level (Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Severe)  



⚡ Key Features
✅ LLM-powered text analysis for mental health insights 
✅ Fine-tuned BERT model for depression level classification
✅ MERN stack frontend for user interaction
✅ Groq API for efficient mental health predictions 
✅ Secure API integration with CORS handling 
✅ Scalable and deployable on cloud platforms
